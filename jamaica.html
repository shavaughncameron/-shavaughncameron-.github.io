						Track and field cannot be mentioned without talking about the great Usain St. Leo Bolt, an absolute legend in Jamaica’s track and field he is currently the fastest 100m world record holder. At an advantageous and controversial height of 1.96 metres he is able to double the length of his opponents stride with just one stride, even though his height aided him to these amazing things he was considered too tall for sprint events with persons thinking that his height would affect his performance. He has a total of six (6) Olympic Gold medal which is evenly divided between 100m and 200m sprint. He was born on August 21, 1986. At the age of just fifteen Usain Bolt took part in the world junior championships held at the Jamaica’s in 2002 at the national stadium in Kingston, Jamaica, at that event he won a goal medal being the youngest male junior champion in any event. The following year bolt shattered the record for the junior 200-metre World record in 20.13 seconds. In the coming years bolt would suffer some loss; pulling his hamstring in 2004 the Olympics and losing a world championship final in 2005.
						For the following years he proceeded to break multiple records. </br>
						Current superstar in the area: Shelly-Ann Fraser Pryce, born on December 7, 1986. At the age of 21 she made her entrance to the Olympics by becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100 metre sprint.
